# lets_drink


Lets_Drink is a software development project that allows users to 
obtain information about their favourite cocktails. 
In addition, it allows to get information about cocktails of the same category 
or with same alchool type and return all the characteristics available
in order to create and serve the requested drink.



If the name of the cocktail given as input is not present or
not available you can also insert it. 
All of this can be managed directly from the user's machine terminal.

In the following paragraphs you'll find a general overview about the original CSV file from
which we have taken the initial data, as well as a short explanation of how the software 
works and the outputs the user can obtain.
