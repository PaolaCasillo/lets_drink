"""
This is the main file where we created
the interaction between the user and the
database of drinks.
We used the argparse module to configure
all the positional and optional arguments.
Depending on the arguments given,
the program leads the user to a series of steps
to either check the presence of the cocktail imputed
inside the database and/or add it.
There is also the possibility to check out
the association between cocktails and alchol type.
